Good abstractions are the once that are able to allow software and hardware to evolve over time, independently of each other:
- CPU instructions <- ISA -> SW
- OS kernel <- system calls -> user processes
- services <- IPC (message passing) -> applications
- hard drives <- file systems -> files/directories
- Applications <- Image / Texture -> Compositing window manager
...
