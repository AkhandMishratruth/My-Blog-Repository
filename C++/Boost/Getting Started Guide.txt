====

Context:
make_fcontext and jump_fcontext -> contexts do not return, but you can switch between them using jump_fcontext
-> Each context has its own stack. Everything else is shared.

Coroutine:
Coroutine is a simple library that is built upon Context to have a somewhat nicer API. But is does not provide scheduling.

Fiber:
Fiber is a simple library that is built upon Content to provide round-robin scheduling for contexts.
It also brings mutexes and communication channels that suspend and resume the contexts.
