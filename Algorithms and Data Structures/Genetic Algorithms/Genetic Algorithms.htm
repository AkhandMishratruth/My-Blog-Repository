<P><B>Coevolution</B><BR>(Hillis, 1990)<BR>Evolve the fitness function together 
with the population (<I>host-parasite principle</I>).<BR>This is to avoid that 
the search gets stuck at local optima (basically it keeps making the search more 
challenging).</P>
<P><B>Adaptive Mutation</B><BR>(Kitano, 1990)<BR>The probability of mutation of 
a offspring depends on the number of mismatches (Hamming distance in case of "1" 
and "0" between the two parents).</P>
<P><B>Adaptive Encoding</B><BR>How to encode the chromosomes? To find the best 
possible encoding is very similar to already know the 
solution!<BR><I>Linkage</I>: one wants to have functionally related loci in the 
chromosome to "stay together", i.e. not to get separated upon 
crossover<BR><I>Variable Length</I>: (Lindgren, 1992)<BR><I>Messy GAs</I>:

<P><B>Genetic programming</B><BR>(Koza, 1992, 1994)<BR>Automatically create a 
computer program (basically, an algorithm, block by block) that correctly solves 
a task.<BR>The point is to choose a set of possible functions that the program 
can use and to start with a random population. Each member of the population has 
some of the functions connected at random.<BR>The genetic algorithm evolves on 
two fronts: which functions are present and how they are connected.<BR>Fitness 
is measured on a number of test cases for which the output must be 
known.<BR><BR><B>Cellular Automata</B><BR>(Mitchell and others, 1992, 1993, 
1994)<BR>Genetic Algorithms could be used to better understand how cellular 
automata evolve.<BR>Some hype on cellular automata has been raised in 2002 by 
Wolfram's book with a popular science approach.</P>
<P><B>Data Analysis</B><BR>(Packard 1990)<BR>Find patterns and "rules" within 
huge amount of datas.</P>

Neural Network<BR>(Miller, Todd, Hedge, 1989): Evolving the architecture of a NN 
with Direct Encoding<BR>(Kitano, 1990): Evolving the architecture of a NN with 
Grammatical Encoding<BR></P>
<P><B>Study of the Baldwin Effect</B><BR>Baldwin (1896): if learning increases 
the probability of survival then the organisms best able to learn will have the 
most offspring thus increasing the frequency of the genes responsible for 
learning (<I>Baldwin effect</I> or <I>organic selection</I>).<BR>GAs have been 
used to study the Baldwin effect.<BR>(Ackley and Littman, 1992)<BR>Simulation of 
a "survival" scenario with many "agents" (characters).<BR>The GA is used to 
simulate a large number of generations. Performed a study about what matters 
more: the "ability to learn" something or the "ability to do" something.</P>
<P><B>Study of Sexual Selection</B><BR>(Kirkpatrick, 1982)<BR>(Collins and 
Jefferson, 1992)<BR>A GA is used to study how sexual selection interacts with 
natural selection (for example, if there is a trait which increases the fitness 
for the sexual selection but reduces the fitness for the natural selection, i.e. 
it reduces the chances of survival but makes the agent who has the trait more 
sexually appealing).<BR>The study concludes that the power of sexual selection 
if stronger than the one of natural selection.</P>

Interactions</B><BR>It's one the most recent frontiers.</P>

fitness", "degree of symmetry", and so on)<BR>Selection causes the standard 
deviation of the distribution of the population to be lowered (the population
