					A hash function maps a bit vector onto another, usually shorter, bit
					vector. The result is uniformly distributed, which means that for an input
					vector chosen at random, each out bit is equally likely to be 0 or 1 and 
					is not correlated with the other bits (unless the size of the range is not
					a power of 2 in which case the high bits will show correlations). 
				</p>
				<p>
					Typically, m > n and this is why
					hash functions are called <i>compression functions</i> in some applications.
					Because the function is non-invertible, it means that not all m-bit
					input vectors can be losslessly compressed by the same function, or even
					by different functions if you count the bits required to indicate which
					compression function is to be used.

			<p>
				Hash functions are functions that map a bit vector to another bit vector,
				usually shorter than the original vector and usually of fixed length for
				a particular function.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are three primary uses for hash functions:
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Fast table lookup</li>
				<li>Message digests</li>
				<li>Encryption</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h2>Fast Table Lookup</h2>
			
			<p>
				Fast table lookup can be implemented using a hash function and a hash table.
				Elements are found in the hash table by calculating the hash of the
				element's key and using the hash value as the index into the table. This is
				clearly faster than other methods, such as examining each element of the table
				sequentially to find a match.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Message Digests</h2>
			
			<p>
				Message digests allow you to compare two large bit vectors and quickly
				determine if they are equal. Instead of comparing the vectors bit-by-bit,
				if the hash values of each bit vector are available you can compare the
				hash values. If the hash values are different, the original vectors must
				be different. If the hash values are the same then the original vectors
				are very likely to be the same if the hash function is good.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Message digests can use either cryptographic or non-cryptographic hash
				functions. If the purpose of the message digest is to determine if the
				original message has been tampered with, you would need to use a 
				cryptographic hash function. If you just want to quickly tell if it's
				the same as another file with a different name (assuming the hash values
				have already been computed), you can use a non-cryptographic hash function.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Encryption</h2>
			
			<div class="sidebar">
				<img src="fig2.gif" width="344" height="162" alt="Figure 2" title="" />
				<br/><br/>
				Collision! Two different input vectors produce the same output vector.
				For hash tables, this means that the second table insertion will be slower
				because an alternate location will need to be used. For non-cryptographic
				message digests, it means that two messages will appear to be the same
				when they are not. For cryptographic message digests, it means the contents
				of the message and/or the identity of the sender can be undetectibly altered.
			</div>
			
			<p>
				Encryption is the transformation of data into a form unreadable by anyone 
				without a secret decryption key. Hash functions play an important role in 
				encryption because it is their properties that cause the encrypted data to be 
				unreadable and the original data to be unrecoverable from the encrypted data 
				without the decryption key.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Hash functions in this context are sometimes given other names such as
				mixing functions.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Properties of Hash Functions</h2>
			
			<p>
				For a function to be useful as a hash function, it must exhibit the property of
				<i>uniform distribution</i>. Some hash functions also have the
				<i>one-way</i> property. If a hash function is to be used for cryptography
				or for fast table lookup where the nature of the keys is unknown,
				the one-way property is a requirement.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Uniform Distribution</h2>
			
			<p>
				All good hash functions share the property of <i>collision 
				avoidance</i>, which means that the desired behavior is for unique inputs
				to provide unique outputs. If the length of the input vector is
				greater than the length of the output vector it's impossible to avoid
				all collisions because the set of input vectors will be of greater
				order than the set of output vectors. The hash function partitions the
				input set into subsets of input vectors that all produce the same 
				output. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since collisions cannot be avoided, the goal is to minimize their 
				likelihood given two arbitrary input vectors. Minimization occurs when 
				the size of the largest partition is minimized, that is, when the output
				vectors are evenly distributed among the corresponding input vectors.
				When this happens we say the output vectors are <i>uniformly distributed</i>.
			</p>
			
			<h2>One-Way Functions</h2>
			
			<p>
				Another important goal is that "similar" input vectors produce very
				different output vectors. For the case of table lookup, table keys are 
				usually either human language strings, index numbers, or other data that 
				exhibit non-randomness. For the case of message digest functions, the 
				goal is to make it as difficult as possible to find two different messages 
				that result in the same hash. A hash function with this property is called
				a <i>one-way</i> hash function.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not all applications require hash functions to be one-way, but all 
				cryptographic applications do. For example, a hash value for fast table
				lookup where the keys are telephone numbers could simply be the last four 
				digits of the phone number. This hash function is suitable 
				because it's likely to be uniformly distributed, but it's clearly not one-way
				because it is easy to devise a phone number that has a specific
				hash value.
